  <section id="what-is-a-computer-cluster">
<h1>What is a computer cluster?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-computer-cluster" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h1>
<p>A <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster">computer cluster</a> is a set
of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that, in many
respects, they can be viewed as a single system.</p>
</section>
<section id="parts-of-a-computing-cluster">
<h1>Parts of a computing cluster<a class="headerlink" href="#parts-of-a-computing-cluster" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h1>
<p>To provide high performance computation capabilities, clusters can
combine hundreds to thousands of computers, called <em>nodes</em>, which are all
inter-connected with a high-performance communication network. Most nodes are
designed for high-performance computations, but clusters can also use
specialized nodes to offer parallel file systems, databases, login nodes and
even the cluster scheduling functionality as pictured in the image below.</p>
<img alt="_images/cluster_overview2.png" src="_images/cluster_overview2.png" />
<p>We will overview the different types of nodes which you can encounter on a
typical cluster.</p>
<section id="the-login-nodes">
<h2>The login nodes<a class="headerlink" href="#the-login-nodes" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>To execute computing processes on a cluster, you must first connect to a
cluster and this is accomplished through a <em>login node</em>. These so-called
login nodes are the entry point to most clusters.</p>
<p>Another entry point to some clusters such as the Mila cluster is the JupyterHub
web interface, but we‚Äôll read about that later. For now let‚Äôs return to the
subject of this section; Login nodes. To connect to these, you would typically
use a remote shell connection. The most usual tool to do so is SSH. You‚Äôll hear
and read a lot about this tool. Imagine it as a very long (and somewhat
magical) extension cord which connects the computer you are using now, such as
your laptop, to a remote computer‚Äôs terminal shell. You might already know what
a terminal shell is if you ever used the command line.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-compute-nodes">
<h2>The compute nodes<a class="headerlink" href="#the-compute-nodes" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>In the field of artificial intelligence, you will usually be on the hunt for
GPUs. In most clusters, the compute nodes are the ones with GPU capacity.</p>
<p>While there is a general paradigm to tend towards a homogeneous configuration
for nodes, this is not always possible in the field of artificial intelligence
as the hardware evolve rapidly as is being complemented by new hardware and so
on. Hence, you will often read about computational node classes. Some of which
might have different GPU models or even no GPU at all. For the Mila cluster you
will find this information in the <a class="reference internal" href="Information.html#node-profile-description"><span class="std std-ref">Node profile description</span></a> section. For
now, you should note that is important to keep in mind that you should be aware
of <em>which</em> nodes your code is running on.  More on that later.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-storage-nodes">
<h2>The storage nodes<a class="headerlink" href="#the-storage-nodes" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>Some computers on a cluster function to only store and serve files.  While the
name of these computers might matter to some, as a user, you‚Äôll only be
concerned about the path to the data. More on that in the <a class="reference internal" href="#processing-data"><span class="std std-ref">Processing data</span></a> section.</p>
</section>
<section id="different-nodes-for-different-uses">
<h2>Different nodes for different uses<a class="headerlink" href="#different-nodes-for-different-uses" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>It is important to note here the difference in intended uses between the
compute nodes and the login nodes. While the compute nodes are meant for heavy
computation, the login nodes are not.</p>
<p>The login nodes however are used by everyone who uses the cluster and care must
be taken not to overburden these nodes. Consequently, only very short and light
processes should be run on these otherwise the cluster may become inaccessible.
In other words, please refrain from executing long or compute intensive
processes on login nodes because it affects all other users. In some cases, you
will also find that doing so might get you into trouble.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="unix">
<h1>UNIX<a class="headerlink" href="#unix" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h1>
<p>All clusters typically run on GNU/Linux distributions. Hence a minimum
knowledge of GNU/Linux and BASH is usually required to use them. See the
following <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Linux_introduction">tutorial</a>
for a rough guide on getting started with Linux.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-workload-manager">
<h1>The workload manager<a class="headerlink" href="#the-workload-manager" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h1>
<p>On a cluster, users don‚Äôt have direct access to the compute nodes but
instead connect to a login node and add jobs to the workload manager
queue. Whenever there are resources available to execute these jobs
they will be allocated to a compute node and run, which can be
immediately or after a wait of up to several days.</p>
<section id="anatomy-of-a-job">
<h2>Anatomy of a job<a class="headerlink" href="#anatomy-of-a-job" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>A job is comprised of a number of steps that will run one after the
other. This is done so that you can schedule a sequence of processes
that can use the results of the previous steps without having to
manually interact with the scheduler.</p>
<p>Each step can have any number of tasks which are groups of processes
that can be scheduled independently on the cluster but can run in
parallel if there are resources available. The distinction between
steps and tasks is that multiple tasks, if they are part of the same
step, cannot depend on results of other tasks because there are no
guarantees on the order in which they will be executed.</p>
<p>Finally each process group is the basic unit that is scheduled in the
cluster. It comprises of a set of processes (or threads) that can run
on a number of resources (CPU, GPU, RAM, ‚Ä¶) and are scheduled
together as a unit on one or more machines.</p>
<p>Each of these concepts lends itself to a particular use. For multi-gpu
training in AI workloads you would use one task per GPU for data
paralellism or one process group if you are doing model
parallelism. Hyperparameter optimisation can be done using a
combination of tasks and steps but is probably better left to a
framework outside of the scope of the workload manager.</p>
<p>If this all seems complicated, you should know that all these things
do not need to always be used. It is perfectly acceptable to sumbit
jobs with a single step, a single task and a single process.</p>
</section>
<section id="understanding-the-queue">
<h2>Understanding the queue<a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-the-queue" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>The available resources on the cluster are not infinite and it is the
workload manager‚Äôs job to allocate them. Whenever a job request comes
in and there are not enough resources available to start it
immediately, it will go in the queue.</p>
<p>Once a job is in the queue, it will stay there until another job
finishes and then the workload manager will try to use the newly freed
resources with jobs from the queue. The exact order in which the jobs
will start is not fixed, because it depends on the local policies
which can take into account the user priority, the time since the job
was requested, the amount of resources requested and possibly other
things. There should be a tool that comes with the manager where you
can see the status of your queued jobs and why they remain in the
queue.</p>
</section>
<section id="about-partitions">
<h2>About partitions<a class="headerlink" href="#about-partitions" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>The workload manager will divide the cluster into partitions according
to the configuration set by the admins. A partition is a set of
machines typically reserved for a particular purpose. An example might
be CPU-only machines for preprocessing setup as a separate partition.
It is possible for multiple partitions to share resources.</p>
<p>There will always be at least one partition that is the default
partition in which jobs without a specific request will go. Other
partitions can be requested, but might be restricted to a group of
users, depending on policy.</p>
<p>Partitions are useful for a policy standpoint to ensure efficient use
of the cluster resources and avoid using up too much of one resource
type blocking use of another. They are also useful for heterogenous
clusters where different hardware is mixed in and not all software is
compatible with all of it (for example x86 and POWER cpus).</p>
</section>
<section id="exceding-limits-preemption-and-grace-periods">
<h2>Exceding limits (preemption and grace periods)<a class="headerlink" href="#exceding-limits-preemption-and-grace-periods" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>To ensure a fair share of the computing resources for all, the workload
manager establishes limits on the amount of resources that a single
user can use at once. These can be hard limits which prevent running
jobs when you go over or soft limits which will let you run jobs, but
only until some other job needs the resources.</p>
<p>Admin policy will determine what those exact limits are for a
particular cluster or user and whether they are hard or soft limits.</p>
<p>The way soft limits are enforced is using preemption, which means that
when another job with higher priority needs the resources that your
job is using, your job will receive a signal that it needs to save its
state and exit. It will be given a certain amount of time to do this
(the grace period, which may be 0s) and then forcefully terminated if
it is still running.</p>
<p>Depending on the workload manager in use and the cluster configuration
a job that is preempted like this may be automatically rescheduled to
have a chance to finish or it may be up to the job to reschedule
itself.</p>
<p>The other limit you can encounter with a job that goes over its
declared limits. When you schedule a job, you declare how much
resources it will need (RAM, CPUs, GPUs, ‚Ä¶). Some of those may have
default values and not be explicitely defined. For certain types of
devices, like GPUs, access to units over your job limit is made
unavailable. For others, like RAM, usage is monitored and your job
will be terminated if it goes too much over. This makes it important
to ensure you estimate resource usage accurately.</p>

<h2>Mila information<a class="headerlink" href="#mila-information" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p><strong>Mila</strong> as well as <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Technical_documentation">Digital Research Alliance of Canada</a> use the workload
manager <a class="reference external" href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html">Slurm</a> to schedule and
allocate resources on their infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Slurm</strong> client commands are available on the login nodes for you to submit
jobs to the main controller and add your job to the queue. Jobs are of 2 types:
<em>batch</em> jobs and <em>interactive</em> jobs.</p>

<section id="processing-data">
<h1>Processing data<a class="headerlink" href="#processing-data" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h1>
<p>For processing large amounts of data common for deep learning, either
for dataset preprocessing or training, several techniques exist. Each
has typical uses and limitations.</p>
<section id="data-parallelism">
<h2>Data parallelism<a class="headerlink" href="#data-parallelism" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>The first technique is called <strong>data parallelism</strong> (aka task
parallelism in formal computer science). You simply run lots of
processes each handling a portion of the data you want to
process. This is by far the easiest technique to use and should be
favored whenever possible. A common example of this is
hyperparameter optimisation.</p>
<p>For really small computations the time to setup multiple processes
might be longer than the processing time and lead to waste. This can
be addressed by bunching up some of the processes together by doing
sequential processing of sub-partitions of the data.</p>
<p>For the cluster systems it is also inadvisable to launch thousands of
jobs and even if each job would run for a reasonable amount of time
(several minutes at minimum), it would be best to make larger groups
until the amount of jobs is in the low hundreds at most.</p>
<p>Finally another thing to keep in mind is that the transfer bandwidth
is limited between the filesystems (see <a class="reference internal" href="#filesystem-concerns"><span class="std std-ref">Filesystem concerns</span></a>)
and the compute nodes and if you run too many jobs using too much data
at once they may end up not being any faster because they will spend
their time waiting for data to arrive.</p>
</section>
<section id="model-parallelism">
<h2>Model parallelism<a class="headerlink" href="#model-parallelism" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>The second technique is called <strong>model parallelism</strong> (which doesn‚Äôt
have a single equivalent in formal computer science). It is used
mostly when a single instance of a model will not fit in a computing
resource (such as the GPU memory being too small for all the
parameters).</p>
<p>In this case, the model is split into its constituent parts, each
processed independently and their intermediate results communicated
with each other to arrive at a final result.</p>
<p>This is generally harder but necessary to work with larger, more
powerful models like GPT.</p>
</section>
<section id="communication-concerns">
<h2>Communication concerns<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-concerns" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>The main difference of these two approaches is the need for
communication between the multiple processes. Some common training
methods, like stochastic gradient descent sit somewhere between the
two, because they require some communication, but not a lot. Most
people classify it as data parallelism since it sits closer to that
end.</p>
<p>In general for data parallelism tasks or tasks that communicate
infrequently it doesn‚Äôt make a lot of difference where the processes
sit because the communication bandwidth and latency will not have a
lot of impact on the time it takes to complete the job.  The
individual tasks can generally be scheduled independently.</p>
<p>On the contrary for model parallelism you need to pay more attention
to where your tasks are.  In this case it is usually required to use
the facilities of the workload manager to group the tasks so that they
are on the same machine or machines that are closely linked to ensure
optimal communication.  What is the best allocation depends on the
specific cluster architecture available and the technologies it
support (such as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand">InfiniBand</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_direct_memory_access">RDMA</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVLink">NVLink</a> or others)</p>
</section>
<section id="filesystem-concerns">
<h2>Filesystem concerns<a class="headerlink" href="#filesystem-concerns" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>When working on a cluster, you will generally encounter several
different filesystems.  Usually there will be names such as ‚Äòhome‚Äô,
‚Äòscratch‚Äô, ‚Äòdatasets‚Äô, ‚Äòprojects‚Äô, ‚Äòtmp‚Äô.</p>
<p>The reason for having different filesystems available instead of a
single giant one is to provide for different use cases. For example,
the ‚Äòdatasets‚Äô filesystem would be optimized for fast reads but have
slow write performance. This is because datasets are usually written
once and then read very often for training.</p>
<p>Different filesystems have different performance levels. For instance, backed
up filesystems (such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$PROJECT</span></code> in Digital Research Alliance of Canada
clusters) provide more space and can handle large files but cannot sustain
highly parallel accesses typically required for high speed model training.</p>
<p>The set of filesystems provided by the cluster you are using should be
detailed in the documentation for that cluster and the names can
differ from those above. You should pay attention to their recommended
use case in the documentation and use the appropriate filesystem for
the appropriate job. There are cases where a job ran hundreds of times
slower because it tried to use a filesystem that wasn‚Äôt a good fit for
the job.</p>
<p>One last thing to pay attention to is the data retention policy for
the filesystems. This has two subpoints: how long is the data kept
for, and are there backups.</p>
<p>Some filesystems will have a limit on how long they keep their
files. Typically the limit is some number of days (like 90 days) but
can also be ‚Äòas long as the job runs‚Äô for some.</p>
<p>As for backups, some filesystems will not have a limit for data, but
will also not have backups. For those it is important to maintain a
copy of any crucial data somewhere else. The data will not be
purposefully deleted, but the filesystem may fail and lose all or part
of its data. If you have any data that is crucial for a paper or your
thesis keep an additional copy of it somewhere else.</p>

<section id="software-on-the-cluster">
<h1>Software on the cluster<a class="headerlink" href="#software-on-the-cluster" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h1>
<p>This section aims to raise awareness to problems one can encounter when trying
to run a software on different computers and how this is dealt with on typical
computation clusters.</p>
<p>The Mila cluster and the Digital Research Alliance of Canada clusters both
provide various useful software and computing environments, which can be
activated through the module system. Alternatively, you may build containers
with your desired software and run them on compute nodes.</p>
<p>Regarding Python development, we recommend using virtual environments to install
Python packages in isolation.</p>
<section id="cluster-software-modules">
<h2>Cluster software modules<a class="headerlink" href="#cluster-software-modules" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>Modules are small files which modify your environment variables to point to
specific versions of various software and libraries. For instance, a module
might provide the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python</span></code> command to point to Python 3.7, another might
activate CUDA version 11.0, another might provide the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">torch</span></code> package, and so
on.</p>

<h2>Containers<a class="headerlink" href="#containers" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>Containers are a special form of isolation of software and its dependencies. A
container is essentially a lightweight virtual machine: it encapsulates a
virtual file system for a full OS installation, as well as a separate network
and execution environment.</p>
<p>For example, you can create an Ubuntu container in which you install various
packages using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">apt</span></code>, modify settings as you would as a root user, and so on,
but without interfering with your main installation. Once built, a container can
be run on any compatible system.</p>

<h2>Python Virtual environments<a class="headerlink" href="#python-virtual-environments" title="Link to this heading">ÔÉÅ</a></h2>
<p>A virtual environment in Python is a local, isolated environment in which you
can install or uninstall Python packages without interfering with the global
environment (or other virtual environments). In order to use a virtual
environment, you first have to activate it.</p>
