## Intended audience

This documentation is mainly intended for Mila researchers having access to the
Mila cluster. This access is determined by your researcher status. See
[Roles and authorizations](#Roles and authorizations) for more information. The core of the
information with this purpose can be found in the following section:
[Computing infrastructure and policies](#Computing infrastructure and policies).

However, we also aim to provide more general information which can be useful
outside the scope of using the Mila cluster. For instance, more general theory
on computational considerations and such. In this perspective, we hope the
documentation can be of use for all AI researchers.
