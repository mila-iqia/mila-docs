# Data Transmission using Globus Connect Personal
<!-- TODO: Could be moved to a section in a different page maybe? -->
Mila doesn't own a Globus license but if the source or destination provides a
Globus account, like Digital Research Alliance of Canada for example, it's
possible to setup Globus Connect Personal to create a personal endpoint on the
Mila cluster by following the Globus guide to [Install, Configure, and
Uninstall Globus Connect Personal for Linux](https://docs.globus.org/how-to/globus-connect-personal-linux/).

This endpoint can then be used to transfer data to and from the Mila cluster.
