Data Transmission using Globus Connect Personal
===============================================


Mila doesn't own a Globus license but if the source or destination provides a
Globus account, like Compute Canada for example, it's possible to setup Globus
Connect Personal to create a personal endpoint on the Mila cluster by following
the Globus guide to `Install, Configure, and Uninstall Globus Connect Personal
for Linux <https://docs.globus.org/how-to/globus-connect-personal-linux/>`_.

This endpoint can then be used to transfer data to and from the Mila cluster.
