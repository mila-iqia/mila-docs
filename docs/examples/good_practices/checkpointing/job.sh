# Use the `--offline` option of `uv run` on clusters without internet access on compute nodes.
# Using the `--locked` option can help make your experiments easier to reproduce (it forces
# your uv.lock file to be up to date with the dependencies declared in pyproject.toml).
# Here we use `exec` to ensure that the signals are received and handled in the Python process.
