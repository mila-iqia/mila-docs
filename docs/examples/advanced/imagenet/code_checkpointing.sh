## Code checkpointing utility script ##
# When used in conjunction with `safe_sbatch` to submit jobs, this prevents
# changes in the python files between the job submission and job start from causing 
# unexpected bugs. This also greatly helps reproducibility of your experiments.

# Usage:
# - This should be called from within a SLURM sbatch job script.
# - This clones the project on each node's local storage at the current commit.
# - This creates the virtual environment for the project at that commit on each node's local storage using UV.
# - This returns the directory that should then be passed to the `uv run` commands in the rest of the job script.

# Assumptions:
# - This assumes that we're inside the project when submitting a job.
# - This assumes that the project uses Git and UV (https://docs.astral.sh/uv).

set -e  # exit on error.

# We need to know where to go after cloning the repo in /tmp.

# Expect this GIT_COMMIT variable to be set by the `safe_sbatch` submission script or similar.

# The directory where UV commands should be executed.
# - If code checkpointing is not used, this is the current directory.
# - If code checkpointing is used, this is the path from the parent folder of the project root
#   to the current directory where the job is submitted. The same relative path is recreated
#   with $SLURM_TMPDIR as a base.
