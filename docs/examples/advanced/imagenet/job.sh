# srun is always used to launch the tasks.
# Whether there is one 'task' per GPU or one task per node can vary based on your setup.
# In the latter case, you would typically use torchrun or accelerate to launch one processes
# per GPU within each task.
# See the commented examples below for different ways to launch the training script.

# Important note: In all cases, some variables (for example RANK, LOCAL_RANK, or machine_rank
# in accelerate) vary between tasks, so we need to escape env variables such as $SLURM_PROCID,
# $SLURM_TMPDIR and $SLURM_NODEID so they are evaluated within each task, not just once here
# on the first node.

## Pure SLURM version ##
# They can either be set here or as early as possible in the Python script.
# Use `uv run --offline` on clusters without internet access on compute nodes.
# Using `srun` executes the command once per task, once per GPU in our case.
