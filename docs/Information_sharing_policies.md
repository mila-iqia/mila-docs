# Data sharing policies


!!! note
    [`/network/scratch`](Information_storage.md#scratch) aims to support [Access
    Control Lists
    (ACLs)](https://cl-cheat-sheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#setfacl) to allow
    collaborative work on rapidly changing data, e.g. work in process datasets,
    model checkpoints, etc.


[`/network/projects`](Information_storage.md#projects) aims to offer a collaborative
space for long-term projects. Data that should be kept for a longer period than
90 days can be stored in that location but first a request to [Mila's
helpdesk](https://it-support.mila.quebec) has to be made to create the project
directory.
