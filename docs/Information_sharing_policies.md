[/network/projects ](Information.html#storage) aims to offer a collaborative
space for long-term projects. Data that should be kept for a longer period then
90 days can be stored in that location but first a request to `Mila's helpdesk
<https://it-support.mila.quebec>`_ has to be made to create the project
directory.
